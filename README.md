## **Overview**
In this repository, we implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality using two datasets: Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10, both downloaded via the Keras library. The results indicate that PCA performs better on the Fashion MNIST dataset compared to CIFAR10. 

## **Usage** 
First, install needed packages  
>       pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, access each file .ipynb and cho ```Run All```.
